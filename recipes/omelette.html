    <img src="../images/omelette.jpeg">
    <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon butter or olive oil</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper, to taste</li>
        <li>Optional fillings such as cheese, ham, mushrooms, onions, or herbs</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Instructions:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Crack the eggs into a small bowl and whisk them together until the yolks and whites are fully combined. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>If using fillings, prepare them now by chopping or shredding as needed.</li>
        <li>Heat a nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add the butter or olive oil and swirl to coat the pan.</li>
        <li>Pour the eggs into the pan and let them cook for 10-15 seconds until they begin to set on the bottom.</li>
        <li>Use a spatula to gently push the edges of the omelette towards the center of the pan, tilting the pan to allow the uncooked eggs to flow underneath.</li>
        <li>When the eggs are mostly set but still slightly runny on top, add any fillings you're using to one side of the omelette.</li>
        <li>Use the spatula to carefully fold the other side of the omelette over the fillings, creating a half-moon shape. Slide the omelette onto a plate and serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Enjoy your delicious omelette!</p>
