    <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts</li>
        <li>1/2 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 large eggs, beaten</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups panko breadcrumbs</li>
        <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened</li>
        <li>1/4 cup fresh parsley, chopped</li>
        <li>2 garlic cloves, minced</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon lemon juice</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon black pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Instructions:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 375°F.</li>
        <li>Using a meat mallet, pound the chicken breasts until they are an even thickness.</li>
        <li>In a shallow dish, add the flour. In another shallow dish, beat the eggs. In a third shallow dish, add the panko breadcrumbs.</li>
        <li>Season each chicken breast with salt and black pepper. Dip each chicken breast in the flour, then the eggs, and then coat with the panko breadcrumbs.</li>
        <li>In a bowl, combine the softened butter, chopped parsley, minced garlic, lemon juice, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon black pepper.</li>
        <li>Place the butter mixture on a sheet of plastic wrap and roll into a log. Chill the butter log in the fridge for 20-30 minutes, or until firm.</li>
        <li>Place each chicken breast on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Cut the chilled butter log into 4 equal parts and place one part in the center of each chicken breast.</li>
        <li>Fold the chicken breast around the butter, making sure to seal the edges tightly.</li>
        <li>Bake the chicken in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes, or until the internal temperature of the chicken reaches 165°F.</li>
        <li>Let the chicken rest for a few minutes before serving.</li>
